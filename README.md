In recent years, there are some netizens use internet to harm people which
called the cyberbully. Our research topic is how the cyberbully will lead to
depression, because it is key for us to find out the method which can relieve
the depression. Solving this problem will inform further eﬀorts to create
solu/ons and measures. ABer all the research and the experiment, we finally
can conclude that the extent of depression caused by cyberbully can be
influenced by the diﬀerent online plaEorms and the psychological situa/ons of
vic/ms. Specifically, we find out the ne/zens which always use weibo and the
living-streaming plaEorms will have the highest degree of depression. The
result also means the level of depression will depend on the number of people
which use the plaEorms, comments restric/ons and the strangeness of
ne/zens around them. Secondly, the family rela/onship and the friendship of
users will also aﬀect their level of depression. When we find all these results of
our research ques/on, we make some implements. The main implement of our
group is the app “friend of mdd” in Android system. The app can make the
analysis of people’s depression level, provide the mood diary, give some
medical guide and so on. What’s more, we invite a microblog on the internet
and update some news about the cyberbully-depression. We first employ this
app in our circle of friends, they all have posi/ve comments aBer using them
and provide us some sugges/ons as well. The people who get depression use
our app said that it’s easy for them to use and can be very helpful in the future.
Our research results and implements can all drive the audience to see the
seriousness of depression people and can pay more aMen/on to taking care of
others. What’s more, for the pa/ents, these results can make them have a
deeper understanding about their diseases and prevent their diseases to be
worse.
